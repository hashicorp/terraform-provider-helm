# Resource: {{ .Name }}

A Release is an instance of a chart running in a Kubernetes cluster.

A Chart is a Helm package. It contains all of the resource definitions necessary to run an application, tool, or service inside of a Kubernetes cluster.

`helm_release` describes the desired status of a chart in a kubernetes cluster.

## Example Usage - Chart Repository

{{tffile "examples/resources/release/example_1.tf"}}

## Example Usage - Local Chart

In case a Chart is not available from a repository, a path may be used:

{{tffile "examples/resources/release/example_2.tf"}}

## Example Usage - Chart URL

An absolute URL to the .tgz of the Chart may also be used:

{{tffile "examples/resources/release/example_3.tf"}}

## Example Usage - Chart Repository configured from OCI Registry

Provider supports grabbing charts from an OCI repository:

{{tffile "examples/resources/release/example_4.tf"}}

## Example Usage - Chart Repository configured using GCS/S3

The provider also supports helm plugins such as GCS and S3 that add S3/GCS helm repositories by using `helm plugin install`

{{tffile "examples/resources/release/example_5.tf"}}

{{tffile "examples/resources/release/example_6.tf"}}

## Example Usage - Chart Repository configured outside of Terraform

The provider also supports repositories that are added to the local machine outside of Terraform by running `helm repo add`

{{tffile "examples/resources/release/example_7.tf"}}

The `set`, `set_list`, and `set_sensitive` blocks support:

* `name` - (Required) full name of the variable to be set.
* `value` - (Required) value of the variable to be set.
* `type` - (Optional) type of the variable to be set. Valid options are `auto` and `string`.

Since Terraform Utilizes HCL as well as Helm using the Helm Template Language, it's necessary to escape the `{}`, `[]`, `.`, and `,` characters twice in order for it to be parsed. `name` should also be set to the `value path`, and `value` is the desired value that will be set.

{{tffile "examples/resources/release/example_8.tf"}}

{{tffile "examples/resources/release/example_9.tf"}}

{{tffile "examples/resources/release/example_10.tf"}}

{{tffile "examples/resources/release/example_11.tf"}}

The `postrender` block supports two attributes:

* `binary_path` - (Required) relative or full path to command binary.
* `args` - (Optional) a list of arguments to supply to the post-renderer.

## Upgrade Mode Notes

When using the Helm CLI directly, it is possible (and fairly common) to use `helm upgrade --install` to
_idempotently_ install a release.  For example, `helm upgrade --install mariadb charts/mariadb --verson 7.1.0`
will check to see if there is already a release called `mariadb`: if there is, ensure that it is set to version
7.1.0, and if there is not, install that version from scratch. (See the documentation for the
[helm upgrade](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_upgrade) command for more details.)

Emulating this behavior in the `helm_release` resource might be desirable if, for example, the initial installation
of a chart is handled out-of-band by a CI/CD system and you want to thereafter manage the release with terraform without
having to manually import the release into terraform state each time. But the mechanics of this approach are subtly
different from the defaults and you can easily produce unexpected or undesirable results if you are not careful:
using this approach in production is not necessarily recommended!

If upgrade mode is enabled by setting the `upgrade_install` attribute to `true`, the provider will first check to see
if a release with the given name already exists.  If that release exists, it will attempt to upgrade the release to
the state defined in the resource, using the same strategy as the [helm upgrade](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_upgrade)
command.  In this case, the `generate_name`, `name_template` and `replace` attributes of the resource (if set) are
ignored, as those attributes are not supported by helm's "upgrade" behavior.

If the release does not already exist, the provider will perform a from-scratch installation of the chart.  In this
case, all resource attributes are honored.

## Import

A Helm Release resource can be imported using its namespace and name e.g.

```shell
$ terraform import helm_release.example default/example-name
```

~> **NOTE:** Since the `repository` attribute is not being persisted as metadata by helm, it will not be set to any value by default. All other provider specific attributes will be set to their default values and they can be overriden after running `apply` using the resource definition configuration.
